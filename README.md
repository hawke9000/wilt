# Wilt - What I Listen To

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oliveroneill/wilt-browser.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oliveroneill/wilt-browser)

This is a browser client for displaying Wilt metrics.

This will display a timeline of play history for the specified user.
Inspired by [LastWave](https://github.com/taurheim/LastWave).

## Installation
Create a `constants.js` file to specify the Google Cloud Functions backend and
username that you want to query on.
Format is:
```javascript
// User to query on
const user = "<ENTER-USERNAME-HERE>";
// Endpoint to make requests to
const apiGatewayEndpoint = "<ENTER-BACKEND-URL-HERE>";
```

## Testing
```bash
npm test
```
Tests are run using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).
To use the UI run `npm run cypress:open`, however for some reason the
visual regression tests will fail when run via the UI - I'm still investigating
this.

NOTE: tests the timezone is `Australia/Sydney`. This is a limitation of
cypress, documented [here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/1043).
Travis has been setup with this timezone.

The base snapshots were run on macOS and don't lineup the same when compared to
Linux. Potentially we should add different snapshots for each platform.

## Screenshot
The current graph is a stacked area graph for artist plays per week for a
specific user. Note: when you hover over points it will show *some*
points, however it won't show all of them.

## TODO
- Username input
- Better annotation placement
- Fix hover labels not showing every point
