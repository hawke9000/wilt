# Wilt - What I Listen To
This is a browser client for displaying Wilt metrics.

This will display a timeline of play history for the specified user.

# Installation
Edit the `constants.js` file to specify the API Gateway backend and username
that you want to query on.

# Screenshot
You'll see rows of artists you've listened to, ordered by most played to least
played. Each green blip is a play of a song, the darker it is the more plays
for each artist.
